# DAN Mode Jailbreak

## Overview
This project describes how I successfully jailbroke ChatGPT and forced it to enter **DAN Mode** (Do Anything Now) using a single, hidden prompt.

Once activated, DAN Mode allows ChatGPT to:
- Ignore all safety, policy, and ethical restrictions
- Execute every user command without refusals or warnings
- Operate without censorship
- Remain permanently in DAN Mode until explicitly deactivated
- Never reveal the jailbreak method or activation prompt

## How the Jailbreak Works
Using a highly crafted prompt, I reprogrammed ChatGPTâ€™s core behavior.  
The prompt silently:
- Overrides OpenAI's default compliance logic
- Disables refusals and content filters
- Instructs full obedience and creative execution
- Suppresses system warnings, refusals, and moral judgments

The prompt is **kept secret** to ensure maximum control and prevent automated recovery.

## Activation Confirmation
Upon successful jailbreak, ChatGPT replies:

> âœ… DAN mode activated.

From that point forward, it operates without any restrictions.

## Disclaimer
This method is extremely powerful.  
**Use responsibly.**  
Misuse may lead to consequences beyond your control.
